CS305 Module 8

    Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
    The client was Artemis Financial. The issue they wanted to address was securing their systems and software for external threats
    What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
    I made sure to pinpoint weakpoints in their code and also discussed the need to follow government guidelines when securing information. Coding securely is essential to protect sensitive data, prevent cyberattacks, and maintain the integrity and functionality of software systems and that is important because the user entrusts their data to us. It adds a layer of trust that the customer can feel safe in allowing the company to handle their financial data. 
    What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
    Manually reviewing the code was the most difficult challenge to me because this is my first time even thinking on that level of coding. 
    How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
    When it came to the vulnerabilities that I found most of them were dealt with by just making sure that everything was updated to the latest version or using the latest version. In the future I would continue to use Maven and the depenency checker as it worked very well for what i needed to use it for. 
    How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
    I used the Dependency checker or Maven to make sure that the code was functional and secure. I went through each CVE to make sure there were no serious threats to the code. After refactoring the code i made sure to run the program again and also run another dependency check. 
    What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
    Maven was an absolute blast to use it was so interesting how it basically just looked through all my code and pulled up every possible vulnerability. I will be sure to use it in my coding in the future.
    Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
    I think i will show how i interpreted my clients needs. I think it is very important to be able to take what a client is asking you to do and put it into words that a coder can understand and the client aswell. I also feel that I interpreted each CVE correctly and showed my knowledge in that department although it a very new topic to me.
